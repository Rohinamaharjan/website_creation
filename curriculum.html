    <section id="resources-materials">
        <h2>Resources, Materials, and Activities</h2>
        <p>Early childhood teachers can use the following resources and materials to engage children in integrated curriculum activities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building blocks and construction kits: Facilitate hands-on exploration of engineering and mathematics concepts, allowing children to experiment with design and structure.</li>
            <li>Art supplies (paints, clay, craft materials): Support creativity and artistic expression while integrating scientific principles through experimentation with different materials.</li>
            <li>Science experiment kits: Provide tools for conducting simple experiments, helping children explore scientific concepts and develop critical thinking skills.</li>
